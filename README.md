# My Flutter Journey


### This repository main purpose is to document my journey on learning Flutter. Here you will find a series of mini projects. On each of them I will try to progressively tackle on harder challenges.

## **A little bit of context**

### **Who am I?** 
### My name is Felipe Queiroz, I'm a Computer Science student from PUC-Rio in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. During my years in college and internships I've experimented with a lot of different technologies, from front-end to back-end with a range of different frameworks.

### **But Why?**
### I decided to create this repository in a more personal way. By documenting not just the code but my personal experience as well, I can get a better picture on how exactly I am evolving. For each project I try to point out important things I've learned as well as the biggest challenges I've faced.

### **.BMI Calculator** 
### A true classicâ€¦ What a better way to learn a new language/framework other than this simple example? For my first experience it was nice to learn the Widgets basics as well as Input handling. **See more**

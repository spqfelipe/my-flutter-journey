# My Flutter Journey

*This repository main purpose is to document my journey on learning Flutter. Here you will find a series of mini projects. On each of them I will try to progressively tackle on harder challenges.*

## **A little bit of context**

### **_Who am I?** 
*My name is Felipe Queiroz, I'm a Computer Science student from PUC-Rio in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. During my years in college and internships I've experimented with a lot of different technologies, from front-end to back-end with a range of different frameworks.*

### **_But Why?**
*I decided to create this repository in a more personal way. By documenting not just the code but my personal experience as well, I can get a better picture on how exactly I am evolving.*

A really quick experiment. It was a nice way to start working with async requests and other (a bit more complex) features. 

------

## **What Iâ€™ve learned?**

**Future & Async:** first time working with async process on a mobile framework. I have to say that it was esier that I thought. The "FutureBuilder" widget made things simple and I got eveerything working in no time. 

**Grid Layout:** the grid was the main body of the app. I've learned a lot by building it using the "Grid View" widget. The cell were built individually with it's own small function.(?) This helped to get used with a more modular code when it comes to UI. 

**Share:** it was very quick an easy to setup a share feature with the "share" plugin. Really usefull.

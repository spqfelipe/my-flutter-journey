A really quick experiment. It was a nice way to start working with async requests and other (a bit more complex) features. 

------

## **What Iâ€™ve learned?**

**Future & Async:** first time working with async process on a mobile framework. I have to say that it was easier that I thought. The "FutureBuilder" widget made things simple and I got everything working in no time

**Grid Layout:** the grid was the main body of the app. I've learned a lot by building it using the "Grid View" widget. The cell were built individually with its own small function.(?) This helped to get used with a more modular code when it comes to UI

**Share:** it was very quick and easy to set up a share feature with the "share" plugin. Really useful

## **Biggest Challenges**
By far the biggest challenge was to build the grid itself. As the cells are filled with the API data the whole grid needed to be async and support pagination. 

Other interesting feature to implement was the search. The grid needed to be refreshed with a different endpoint data which made thing a bit more interesting.

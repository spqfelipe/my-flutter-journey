# BMI Calculator

A true classic… What a better way to learn a new language/framework other than this simple example? For my first experience it was nice to the Widgets basics as well as Input Handling.

## **What I’ve learned?**

**Widget System:** the whole Widget System is really intuitive. It was pretty easy to get going with the interface. The ability to make small functions to small parts of the code, like a button, card and etc. Really helps to keep things organized.

**SetState:** the setState method is used to refresh some Widgets and display new things on the screen. There should be a better way to manage the state of widgets, but for now, I liked how the setState method works. 

**Text Controllers:**  using controllers to get data from the text fields was easier that I initially thought. Note that controllers don't need to be refreshed using setState.

## **Biggest Challenges**
As for challenges, I have to say that this was pretty easy. Of course, a BMI Calculator is the simplest example I could think of. No doubt that future projects will bring harder challenges.
